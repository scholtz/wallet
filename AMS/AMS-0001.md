# Algorand Message Standard for public voting

## Summary

This document introduces the standard for public voting participation and calculation of voting results.

## Abstract

The goal of this standard is to make the knowledge based pure democracy reality. This standard defines specification on how organization can propose voting, how organization can create trusted list of voters, how person can cast votes and how person can delegate other persons to vote on his behalf.

The goal of these conventions is to make any organization who seeks public voting the standard on how to vote.

Even if this standard is meant to be for algorand for the effeciency of the transactions and low transaction costs, it is not limitted to this blockchain. It can be used with any blockchain who support self transactions with specific payment, note field with at least 1000 bytes long message, and ability to search the network for specific transactions indexed by the amount, start of the note field, and/or the account.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

Note fields must be compliant with [ARC-0002](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0002.md)

### Question

Question is the message stored on the blockchain.

The blockchain message MUST be self signed message, with amount 702 of basic tokens with specific note structure described below.

Question starts with ```avote-question/v2:j``` according to ARC-0002, following the json data.

If json data is not valid according to JSON standard, the question MUST NOT be shown to the users.

Json data MUST comply with following json schema:

```

### Cast vote

Question is the message stored on the blockchain.

The blockchain message MUST be self signed message, with amount 703 of basic tokens with specific note structure described below.

Question starts with ```avote-vote/v1/{ShortQuestionId}:j``` according to ARC-0002, following the json data.

ShortQuestionId is the tx id of the message with the question for which this vote is answer. ShortQuestionId must be upper case substring from zero with length of 10 characters.

If json data is not valid according to JSON standard, or according to the schema below, the answer MUST NOT be calculated to the final results. If the vote cast code list does not mach with question option codes list, the answer MUST NOT be calculated to the final result.

The weights of the answers MUST be integer numbers in range between 0 and 1000 including. If the weights of results does not match with this criteria, the answer MUST NOT be calculated to the final result.

The voting power of the user is distributed to answers according to specified weights. For example in the example of distribution of ```{"A":35,"B":73,"C":20}``` the sum of the weights is 128, so the voting power of the casted vote for ```A``` is ```35/128~=27,3%```

Json data MUST comply with following json schema:

        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

```

### Extension 1 - Vote delegation

Vote delegation is the extension for the voting system. It MAY not have to be used by the voting system implementation. If the voting system does not implement delegation, it should clearly state that voting system does not support delegation of the voting power. For knowledge based pure democracy voting system it is highly RECOMMENDED to use the delegation of the voting power.

Vote delegation is the delegation of the voting power from the delegee account to delegated account. If delegee does not vote, and delegated account votes for question, the delegated account votes with voting power of it self plus sum of voting power of all delegee accounts.

The delegation SHOULD be used in these usecases.
- Person 1 trusts his friend Person 2 in all matters. Person 1 delegates all his/her voting power to Person 2. Person 1 may vote for questions he believes knows the best answer to. With all other voting where Person 2 votes, the Person 1 votes with the Person 2.
- Person 1 trusts Politician 1 in the matter of Finance, and Politician 2 in the matter of IT. Politicians will vote in their specified field of interest, and gain the Person 1 voting power.

The blockchain message MUST be self signed message, with amount 701 of basic tokens with specific note structure described below.

Vote delegation note field in the blockchain MUST start with ```avote-delegation/v1:j``` according to ARC-0002, following the json data.

If json data is not valid according to JSON standard, or according to the schema below, the voting power MUST NOT be transfered. 

The weights of the delegation between accounts MUST be integer numbers in range between 0 and 1000 including.

Json data MUST comply with following json schema:

```

    ],

    ],

            "description": "The object of categories with the object of accounts and the weights. Weight must be integer number in range from 0 to 1000 including.",
            "default": {},
            "examples": [
                {"any":{"TESTB74MOARQDWSX4433VWVNO4VJK3PDQWQ4JEOVQQTK3ZIX2MK3JF55TE":20,"TESTC2TMLDK273INHLXCSV235NFJ5LITNFDXZPU7JTZCVCBAZDUSJS4OPU":80},"finance":{"TESTDUUODZVXNO4YKEK4I5I6UU67ANYBJ77JZUI444VAD7V3TL26DVOMFA":1}}
            ],
            "additionalProperties": true
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Example:
```
avote-delegation/v1:j{"d":{"any":{"TESTB74MOARQDWSX4433VWVNO4VJK3PDQWQ4JEOVQQTK3ZIX2MK3JF55TE":20,"TESTC2TMLDK273INHLXCSV235NFJ5LITNFDXZPU7JTZCVCBAZDUSJS4OPU":80},"finance":{"TESTDUUODZVXNO4YKEK4I5I6UU67ANYBJ77JZUI444VAD7V3TL26DVOMFA":1}}}
```


### Extension 2 - Trusted list

The trusted list is implementation extension which allows to calculate the results according to the trusted list specified by the questionaree.

If the voting system implementation does not implement trusted list extension, it should clearly state that the results are calculated only in the form 1 token = 1 vote.

The blockchain message MUST be self signed message, with amount 705 of basic tokens with specific note structure described below.

TL configuration message MUST start with ```avote-tl/v1:j``` according to ARC-0002, following the json data.

Trusted list contains all accounts which were added to the trusted list and which were not removed from the trusted list until the decision time of the voting.

Decision snapshot of the trusted list for the vote calculation is the list of accounts in the trusted list in the final block when it is allowed to vote for the question. The additions or removal from the trusted list in the last question block MUST be processed. If the account is in the list of the accounts to be added as well as in the list to be removed in the single transaction, the removal MUST be applied.
